#PIC'ycle board

An image board for cycling experiences, where one can view the board, by clicking any image view and submit comments, as well as add a new image!
It is still in the development stage, so up to now no login page available. And submitted pics are all from my cycling trip :)

## Technology

Built with Vue.js for the front and Node.js Express.js at the back end.

## To run

If you get the source code, first you should have `node`- installed.
Also you would need a Postgres db, to test it with tables described at sql folder.

* `npm install`
* `node index.js`
* Listening on `localhost:8080` - open your browser!
